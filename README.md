## Introduction

This is the backend component for the project. It provides the necessary APIs and endpoints to manage jobs, applicants, and more. This README guide will walk you through the installation process, usage instructions, and configuration options.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install project dependencies using `pip`:

## Usage

1. Apply migrations to set up the database:

   ```
